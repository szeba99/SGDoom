Let's make a cool stargate mod for (G)ZDoom!

Feel free to use my assets for your project as well.

Currently included:
-Jaffa soldiers
-Serpent guards
-Goa ulds
-wraiths
-replicators

-zat nik tel
-staff weapon
-p90

-hatak 3d model made by me (Gelle Szebaszti√°n)

Many thanks to Clay for weapon sprites, wraith sprites and more.
